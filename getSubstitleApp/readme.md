## Generating the substitle file
 
A substile file is a text file that contains timed text and information corresponding to spoken or written content in a video or film.
There are many substile formats, however in this project, we will use SRT (SubRip)

### Common structure of substile
    Substile index : indicate the order of the substile in the file
    TimeCodes: Start and end time markers, HH:MM:SS:ss
    Substile Texte: the content
